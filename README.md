Progressive Web Application (PWA)

## Definitions
dependency
    - When one file needs another file to function properly.

dependency graph
    - Dependency graphs become increasingly more useful as applications scale, as they make sure that the necessary code is pulled in and bundled with the code it depends on. 
    - This allows for optimized bundles that contain only necessary code.

devDependency
    - a dependency that is only required for local development and testing, and does not need to be installed for proper functionality.

Minification
    - the process of taking our code and removing all unnecessary characters and whitespace without any loss of functionality in an attempt to save file space.

lazy loading
    - defer loading certain assets until they're needed by the application.

image compression
    - Compression will take the data that makes up the image and decrease the image's overall size, with minimal loss to the image's integrity. 
    Lossy image compression: refers to the fact that some of the image data is lost during compression. 
    - Once an image has used lossy compression, you cannot reverse the process due to this loss of data. 
    - The data lost will normally result in almost unnoticeable changes in image quality most of the time.

Page abandonment
    - occurs when a user leaves a webpage without completing the task they set out to do.

paint 
    - occurs when content is loaded on the browser screen
    - contentful paint: which means when any content is loaded
    - meaningful paint: which occurs when the primary content becomes visible.
    
Progressive Web Applications (PWAs) 
    - blend the benefits of a traditional browser experience with those of a mobile application. 
    - PWAs can ensure applications work without an internet connection by using the Service Worker and Cache APIs to cache assets and API responses.

Time to Interactive 
    - this is the time it takes for the webpage being audited to become usable

webpack
    - a module bundler for JavaScript. 
    - webpack simplifies front-end web development by automating many of the aforementioned optimizations.
